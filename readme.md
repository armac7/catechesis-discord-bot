## Meet Bishop Bot
BishopBot is here for all your Catholic knowledge needs. Starting out as a bot for the Catechism of the Catholic Church (originally called Catechism Bot), BishopBot
has since had more and more features tacked on, and more are on the way. Right now, he can cite the entire Catechism of the Catholic Church for you, give you information
on various heresies condemned by the Church, and is soon to have Canon Law as well as a list of all the Catholic Councils added to his repitore as well. 

Here are some of the Features of BishopBot! 🙌
